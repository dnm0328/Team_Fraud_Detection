# Fraud Detection Project 

This is a team assignment that will fall under the time structure of only two days(9-5pm). We will work with the entire 'end to end' pipeline of data science through this case study.  We have touched on several aspects of this throughout the course but have not yet put all the pieces together. This is the final team project for the Galvanize Data Science Immersive program. 

Topics included in this case study include:
* Classification modeling.
* Programming Practice: Handing off models. 
* Teamwork.
* Web applications.
* Website hosting with AWS
* Deploying a DS application.
* Data visualization.
* Results presentation.

#### Caveat 

In order to run this program, our team will need to present from one person's computer. Each member of the team (Dave, Danny, and Rueben) will have the data file on their local machine, but will not be in their repositories. 

REASON: The JSON file is not small enough to transfer back and forth within GitHub, and is not large enough, given our time restraints to worry about cloud computing for EDA. With more time, we will get this into the cloud. For now, due to lack of funding and time, we would like to explain our logic, pipeline, and CRISP-DM principles without worrying about that specific portion of the workflow. 

#### Rough timeline 

* Day 1: Project scoping, Team direction, Model building
* Day 2: Web app and deployment

### Deliverables

***There are two deliverables for this project:***

* A dashboard for investigators to use which helps them identify new events that are worthy of investigation for fraud.  This will pull in new data regularly, and update a useful display for the investigation team.  How you wish to lay this out is up to you.

* A ten-minute presentation on your process and results. 

### Notes

Our team's intention was to start with a very basic pipeline and tune as we progressed. The level of tuning for each step in the workflow was dependedent on the amount of time left in our window.
